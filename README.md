# Flutter-App-deployment-on-Kubernetes

Flutter is an open-source mobile app development framework that is known for its fast development speed and ability to build beautiful and high-performance applications for iOS, Android, and the web. While developing an app with Flutter is relatively easy, deploying it can be a daunting task, especially if you want to deploy it at scale.

Fortunately, Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that can help you deploy and manage your Flutter apps with ease. In this blog, we will discuss the process of deploying a Flutter app on Kubernetes.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. With Kubernetes, you can deploy your Flutter app in a distributed environment, making it easier to scale and manage.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure that you have the following tools installed:

1. Flutter SDK
2. Docker
3. Kubernetes cluster
4. kubectl CLI

## Steps to Deploy a Flutter App on Kubernetes
To deploy a Flutter app on Kubernetes, you need to follow the steps below:

### Step1:Building a Docker Image

The first step in deploying a Flutter app on Kubernetes is to build a Docker image of the app. To do this, we need to create a Dockerfile that describes the steps required to build the image. Here is an example Dockerfile:
```
# Use the official Flutter image as the base image
FROM google/dart-runtime-base:2.7 AS builder

# Create a working directory for the app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pubspec files to the working directory
COPY pubspec.* .

# Download the dependencies
RUN flutter pub get

# Copy the rest of the app to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the release version of the app
RUN flutter build apk --release

# Use a smaller base image for the final image
FROM alpine:3.9

# Copy the built app to the final image
COPY --from=builder /app/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk /app/app.apk

# Expose the port that the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Start the app when the container starts
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.apk"]

```
This Dockerfile uses the official Flutter image as the base image, downloads the app dependencies, builds the app in release mode, and copies the built app to a smaller base image. The resulting image will contain only the files required to run the app and will be much smaller than the Flutter image.

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```
docker build -t my-flutter-app .
```

This command will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag it as my-flutter-app.

### Step 2: Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML File

The next step is to create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file. The deployment YAML file defines the deployment of your app on Kubernetes, including the number of replicas, container image, and other settings. Here is an example YAML file for deploying a Flutter app:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flutter-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flutter-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flutter-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flutter-app
        image: my-flutter-app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

This deployment file creates a Kubernetes deployment with three replicas of the app, using the Docker image we built earlier. It also exposes port 8080, which is the port that the app runs on.

To deploy the app to Kubernetes, run the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

This command will create the Kubernetes deployment described in the deployment.yaml file.

### Step 3: Create a Kubernetes Service YAML File

The next step is to create a Kubernetes service YAML file. The service YAML file defines the networking configuration for your app, including the port and IP address. Here is an example YAML file for creating a Kubernetes service:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-flutter-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-flutter-app
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```
### Step 4: Deploy Your Flutter App on Kubernetes

Once you have created the deployment and service YAML files, you can deploy your Flutter app on Kubernetes by running the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f <your-yaml-file-name>
```
This command will deploy your app on Kubernetes, and you can access it by using the IP address and port specified in the service YAML file.

## Conclusion
Deploying a Flutter app on Kubernetes can be a daunting task, but it is necessary if you want to scale your app and manage it in a distributed environment. By following the steps above, you can deploy your Flutter app on Kubernetes with ease and take advantage of its powerful container orchestration capabilities.
